TouchOSC maps for Ardour

Each directory contains one TouchOSC map and one README file.
The README file contains any setup information in either Ardour
or TouchOSC needed to make it work.

Names ending in tab are designed for tablets (mine is 7inch) and names
ending in phn are small area for phones.

TouchOSC is available for either Android devices or iOS devices.

Contributions are welcome, the author should include their name in
the README file and maybe their irc nic.

The TouchOSC map edit tool is available from https://hexler.net/software/touchosc
look towards the bottom of the page. The noarch version works with Linux
so long as the java runtime is installed on the system... in fact marking it executable
means it can be run from the file manager. The created files are not human readable
(unfortunately) so simple cut and paste for blocks of stuff is not possible with a text
editor.
